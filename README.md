# Admin Panel Demo

A demo for an admin panel has been created here. Throughout the development process, I employed SCSS, a separate front-end structure for each page, drawing from my previous experience with Android. Within the SCSS framework, all visual variables were manually scripted without relying on additional libraries apart from 'Shadow-Box'.

Personally, while utilizing SCSS aligned with my accustomed workflow, I found it lacking in terms of efficiency. As this site serves as a demo, not all functionalities are active. I allocated minimal time to the login feature as it is insignificant to the project's purpose. Accessing the site can be done via the Guest section.

The linkage between users and products is established through Firebase. Due to its demo nature, an additional product section was not implemented. Should you add a new user, registering on Firebase and subsequently clearing your local storage will allow you to log in as that user.
